# Multi-Tenant Configuration for Cake Shop SaaS

This guide explains how to configure PrestaShop for multi-tenant operation in a cake shop SaaS environment.

## What is Multi-Tenancy?

In a SaaS context, multi-tenancy refers to a software architecture where a single instance of the software serves multiple customers (tenants). Each tenant's data is isolated and remains invisible to other tenants.

## PrestaShop Multi-Store vs. Multi-Tenancy

PrestaShop's built-in multi-store feature provides a foundation for multi-tenancy, but additional configuration is needed for a true SaaS implementation:

1. **Multi-Store**: PrestaShop's native feature that allows running multiple shops from a single installation
2. **Multi-Tenancy**: An architectural approach where each tenant (customer) has their own isolated environment

## Setting Up Multi-Tenancy in PrestaShop

### 1. Enable Multi-Store Feature

1. Log in to the PrestaShop back office
2. Go to Advanced Parameters > Multistore
3. Set "Enable Multistore" to "Yes"
4. Save changes

### 2. Create Shop Groups

Shop groups allow you to share certain characteristics between shops while keeping others separate:

1. Go to Advanced Parameters > Multistore
2. Click "Add new shop group"
3. Enter a name for the shop group (e.g., "Sweet Delights Bakery")
4. Configure sharing options:
   - Share customers: No
   - Share available quantities: No
   - Share orders: No
5. Save the shop group
6. Repeat for each cake shop tenant

### 3. Create Shops Within Groups

1. Go to Advanced Parameters > Multistore
2. Click "Add new shop"
3. Enter shop details:
   - Shop name
   - Shop group (select the appropriate tenant group)
   - Category root (create a specific category for this shop)
4. Save the shop

### 4. Configure Domain Mapping

Each shop needs its own domain or subdomain:

1. Go to Advanced Parameters > Multistore
2. Click on the "Configure" icon for the shop
3. Add the shop URL:
   - Domain (e.g., sweetdelights.cakeshopsaas.com)
   - SSL Domain (if using HTTPS)
   - Physical URI (usually "/")
4. Save the URL

### 5. Data Isolation

For true multi-tenancy, ensure data isolation:

#### Database Isolation

Option 1: Separate databases (recommended for larger installations)
- Create a separate database for each tenant
- Modify the database connection parameters for each shop

Option 2: Table prefix isolation
- Use different table prefixes for each shop
- Configure in the shop's settings

#### File System Isolation

1. Create separate media directories for each cake shop
2. Configure PrestaShop to use these directories:
   ```php
   // In config/defines.inc.php
   if (defined('_PS_SHOP_ID_') && _PS_SHOP_ID_ == 1) {
       define('_PS_IMG_DIR_', _PS_ROOT_DIR_.'/img/sweetdelights/');
   } elseif (defined('_PS_SHOP_ID_') && _PS_SHOP_ID_ == 2) {
       define('_PS_IMG_DIR_', _PS_ROOT_DIR_.'/img/chocolatehaven/');
   }
   ```

### 6. Theme and Module Management

1. Each shop can have its own theme
2. Modules can be enabled/disabled per shop
3. Configure which modules are available to which shops

## Advanced Multi-Tenant Features

### Tenant Onboarding Automation

Create scripts to automate the tenant onboarding process:

1. Create a new shop group
2. Create a new shop
3. Configure domain mapping
4. Set up initial products and categories
5. Create admin account for the tenant

### Tenant Isolation Enhancements

1. Implement additional security measures to ensure complete data isolation
2. Use separate caching instances for each tenant
3. Configure separate email settings for each tenant

### Billing and Subscription Management

1. Develop a custom module to manage tenant subscriptions
2. Integrate with payment gateways for recurring billing
3. Implement usage-based billing if needed

## Performance Considerations

1. Use a caching system like Redis or Memcached
2. Implement a CDN for static assets
3. Consider database sharding for large installations
4. Use load balancing to distribute traffic

## Security Best Practices

1. Ensure proper data isolation between tenants
2. Implement strong access controls
3. Regularly audit tenant isolation
4. Use encryption for sensitive data
5. Implement regular security updates
